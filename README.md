# 316-Document-Object-Model

# Project Overview

This simple web application demonstrates various functionalities of the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM). The application allows users to add items to a list, change the background color dynamically, and reset the list. It also includes real-time form validation for user inputs.

Features
. Add Items: Users can add items to a dynamically updating list.
. Change Background Color: A button to toggle the page's background color.
. Reset List: A button to clear all items from the list.

##Form Validation:

#HTML Attribute Validation: Ensures that the input field only accepts alphanumeric characters and spaces.

#DOM Event-based Validation: This method provides real-time feedback by changing the input field's border color based on the entry's validity.
